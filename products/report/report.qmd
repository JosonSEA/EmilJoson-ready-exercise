_In this week's exercise, we practiced cleaning data, looking them over through exploratory figures, and doing so with a collaborator through GitHub._

# Methods 

## Data 
Initial data and scripts templates used for this exercise were provided from https://github.com/ahgroup/data-analysis-template. Original data only included Height, Weight, and Gender - Hotdogs and Shirt were added for this exercise.

## Data Cleanup
Data was visually inspected for anomalies and then subsequently corrected. Corrections include ensuring data types were consistent within each variable, removing potentially incorrect data entries (i.e. individual with weight of 7000), and correcting potentially incorrectly input data (i.e. converting input height of 6 to 182.88 centimeters).

## Statistical analysis
Associations between the variables were assessed using linear regression models (_lm_).

# Results

## Data Summary
The data used in this exercise contained five variables: Height, Weight, Gender, Hotdogs, Shirt - with the former three being part of the original dataset and the latter two added for this exercise. The variables Height, Weight, and Hotdogs are numerical while the variables Gender and Shirt are categorical (Height is reported in centimeters; Weight is reported in kilograms; Gender is reported in M (male), F (female), or O (other); Hotdogs is reported as the number of hotdogs the individual can consume; Shirt is reported in shirt sizes S, M, L, XL.) Summary of the data is provided in Table 1. 
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Summary table of the data used in the exercise."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Height
Height distribution of respondents (Fig. 1) revealed a range of 133 to 183 centimeters. With nine (n=9) data points, the average height across the respondents is 165.7 cm (± 15.1 cm).

```{r}
#| label: fig1-result
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1. Height (cm) distribution of respondents."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-distribution.png"))
```

## Weight

Weight distribution of respondents (Fig. 2) revealed a range of 45 to 110 kilograms. With nine (n=9) data points, the average height across the respondents is 70.1 kg (± 20 kg).

```{r}
#| label: fig2-result
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2. Weight (kg) distribution of respondents."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","weight-distribution.png"))
```

# Analysis
## Height vs Weight
Investigating height and weight did not reveal a significant association (_P_ = 0.43) (Fig. 3).

```{r}
#| label: fig3-result
#| fig-cap: "Figure 3. Scatterplot showing the relationship between height and weight with a fitted linear regression line."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight.png"))
```

Even when including Gender as a predictor (Fig. 4), significant assocaitions were still not observed.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Figure 4. Scatterplot of height versus weight with points colored by gender. The solid line represents the fitted multiple linear regression model."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

Lastly, the Hotdogs and Shirt variables were compared across weight and the analysis found no significant associations as well. 

```{r}
#| label: fig5-result
#| fig-cap: "Figure 5. Scatterplot showing the relationship between hotdogs and weight."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","scatter_weight_hotdog.png"))
```
